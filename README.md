# WebXR-Experiences

In this repository, I have shared my code examples on creating VR experiences on the Web using the WebXR API and A-Frame.

## WebXR Starter App


## A-Frame Topics


### Building a car from primitives

This WebXR application is built using A-Frame. It demonstrated the use of the following features in A-Frame:

* Add textures using assets through the cdn.aframe.io library.
* Inspector use in A-frame.
* Entity-component framework.
* Using JS in A-frame html file.
* Adding user cursor interactions: click, audio, and events.
