# WebXR-Experiences

In this repository, I will be maintaining the resources of how to create WebXR experiences. 

## 360 Image Gallery

This WebXR application is built using A-Frame. It demonstrated the use of the following features in A-Frame:

* Add textures using assets through the cdn.aframe.io library.
* Inspector use in A-frame.
* Entity-component framework.
* Using JS in A-frame html file.
* Adding user cursor interactions: click, audio, and events.
